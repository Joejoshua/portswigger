# Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Vulnerability class that occurs when an application is fetching a remote resource without first validating the user-supplied URL.

## My Challenges
1. [Basic SSRF against the local server](Lab_01/Lab_01.md)
2. [Basic SSRF against another back-end system](Lab_02/Lab_02.md)
3. [SSRF with blacklist-based input filter](Lab_03/Lab_03.md)
4. [SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability](Lab_04/Lab_04.md)
5. [SSRF with whitelist-based input filter](Lab_05/Lab_05.md)
